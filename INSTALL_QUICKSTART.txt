This file is a quickstart guide for using the Domain Access
suite of modules.

For full documentation, see INSTALL.txt and README.txt

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Before proceeding, you must install and configure Drupal
    without installing this module.

    Note that you only need one settings directory and file.

2. Unpack the download and place it in your modules directory.

    Note the path to this directory, it is normally:

      'sites/all/modules'

3. Add the following four lines of code to your settings.php file:

/**
 * Add the domain module setup routine.
 */
include BACKDROP_ROOT . '/modules/domain/settings.inc';

    NOTE: You may need to alter the file path above based on your
    site configuration.  See INSTALL.txt for further help.

    IMPORTANT: You must add these lines to settings.php after the
    $databases. Normally, you should add these lines to the end of the
    settings.php file.

    NOTE: If you perform a Drupal core version upgrade, you must
    remove these lines from settings.php.  See UPGRADE.txt for details.

4. Go to Admin > Modules.  There you will see the Domain module group.

    Only enable the Domain Access module.

    Submit the configuration changes to your modules.

5. Rebuild content access permissions as instructed.

6. Configure permissions for the module, normally you will give your
    site administrators the following permissions:

    -- 'administer domains'
    -- 'set domain access'

    If you intend to use access control for editors, you may wish to set
    the following permissions:

    -- 'assign domain editors'
    -- 'edit domain content'

    For more information see README.txt.

    NOTE: Some of these permissions may be pre-configured for the
    site's administrative role.

7. Read the main README.txt file for the Domain Access module.

8. Go to Admin > Structure > Domain and configure the module.

9. Now you are ready to explore the options available to you.

    The Domain Access suite contains a number of optional helper
    modules.  You do not need to use any of these modules, but
    they may add desirable features.

    Each of the modules has its own INSTALL.txt and README.txt files.
    Please read them carefully before activating them.

----
USING DRUSH

NOTE: When installing from drush, it is proper to pass the URI value for your
site. Include the full path to the installation, as below:

  drush pm-enable domain --uri=http://example.com/optional_subdirectory

Then clear the node access cache:

  drush cache-clear

When prompted, select either option [1] or option [5] to rebuild node access.
